Hello,

Thank you for your feedback and the opportunity to provide additional information.

Our app uses the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission to support a critical core feature: **background audio playback** for educational content, specifically audiobooks and audio learning materials.

Here is a detailed explanation of how the foreground service is used in our app:

- **Background Audio Playback**: Users can listen to audiobook content provided within the app. When a user starts playing an audio track, a foreground service is initiated to ensure continuous playback even if the user minimizes the app or switches to another application.
  
- **Persistent Notification**: While audio playback is active, a persistent notification is displayed in the notification panel. This notification includes media controls (such as play, pause, and stop) and is always visible to the user, ensuring transparency and compliance with Google Play's Foreground Service policy.

- **Core User Experience**: Background audio functionality is fundamental to our appâ€™s user experience. The ability for users to listen to educational materials without keeping the app in the foreground meets user expectations for uninterrupted learning.

We have also updated the previously submitted demonstration video to clearly reflect how the foreground service is implemented in the app. The updated video shows:

- Audio playback starting in the app
- The app being minimized
- A visible, persistent notification remaining in the system tray
- Continued, uninterrupted audio playback during background operation

We kindly request that you review the updated video for a clearer understanding of how the foreground service is utilized in compliance with Google Play's policies.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Please let us know if you require any additional information.

Best regards,  
Tohir Saidazimov
