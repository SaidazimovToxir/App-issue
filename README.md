# Our app uses the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission to support a key functionality:

# 1. Background Audio Playback: The app allows users to play educational audio content and songs. This playback continues even when the app is minimized, using a foreground service with a persistent notification for user control.

# This feature is essential to the core user experience, and the foreground service is required to meet usersâ€™ expectations for uninterrupted media access.

# We have updated the previously submitted demonstration video with a clearer version that more accurately reflects how the foreground service is used in our app. We kindly ask that you review the updated video for a better understanding of the implementation.
